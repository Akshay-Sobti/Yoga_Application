Hello ðŸ‘‹

I have created this project using the MERN Stack. In this web application, a user can register themselves for the yoga classes. 

My approach for this project was:-

Create frontend of the admission form using HTML, CSS and React.js.
Create the backend of the form using Node.js, Express.js and MongoDB.
Do the basic validations as stated.
Show a "Payment Successful" message when the user has registered.

The basic validations which I did in this project are as follows:-
Every input field should be filled by the user.
User name must not be empty.
Age field must be between 18 and 65 years only.
Gender must be specified by the user.
Contact number must consist of 10 digits.
Fees should be exactly equal to Rs 500 and not below or above 500.
User must select a slot in order to make the payment.

Thank you ðŸ˜„
